    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This <strong>Pink Velvet Cake</strong> recipe is here to give a standard boxed cake mix a fun and vibrant spin. Itâ€™s just as tangy, moist, and flavorful as a classic Red Velvet cake, but without the addition of cocoa powder, making it the perfect light and not-too-sweet finish to a meal. </p>

    <!-- recipe steps -->
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1
            <p>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly coat a 9x13-inch baking pan with baking spray; set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 2
            <p>Whisk together cake mix, buttermilk, oil, eggs, and food coloring in a medium bowl until fully combined and no dry streaks remain. Transfer to the prepared baking pan and spread in an even layer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 3
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool completely in pan on a wire rack, about 1 hour.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 
            <p>Beat cream cheese and butter with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 5
            <p>Gradually beat in powdered sugar with mixer on low speed, until smooth and fully combined, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl as needed, about 3 minutes. Add vanilla and salt and beat until just combined.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 6
            <p>Using an offset spatula, spread cream cheese frosting evenly over the top of the cooled cake. Garnish with sprinkles, if desired. Cut into squares and serve.</p>
        </li>
        
    </ol>
